Perform simple analog to digital conversions using software trigger: 
• Initialize ADC for SW trigger, continuous mode 
• loop:◦Convert channel connected to pot on evaluation board
	◦Scale result to 0 to 5000 mV
	◦Light evaluation board LEDs to reflect voltage level
	◦Convert channel connected to the ADC high reference voltage
